Riak CSV

This module aims to give you a simple way to get your buckets as csv dumps.

The main motivation behind this was to be able to create data frames in R a little easier from riak. One could just write an R-package to encode the json, etc...but IMHO the less of that you have R do, the more memory you'll have for your work.

Caveats

Obviously CSV requires that your rows be uniform. Therefore, if you have a bucket with non uniform entries it's going to get hairy.

For now the first item (in the bucket) will have its properties extracted and those will be used to pluck all the subsequent values.
